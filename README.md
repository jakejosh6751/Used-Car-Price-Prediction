# Used Car Price Prediction:
## A Linear Regression Model to Estimate Prices of Used Cars

### 1. Project Overview
Estimating used car prices involves analyzing features like mileage, age, fuel type, engine size, and overall condition. Prices vary significantly based on these attributes, making price predictions essential.

Building accurate models helps buyers and sellers make fair decisions, supports dealerships in pricing strategies, and promotes transparency in the used car market.

To keep this analysis simple, only toyota models are used. However, the process can be extended to accomodate other products when required.

#### 1.1 Objective
- Analyze factors influencing used car prices.
- Build a linear regression model to predict prices base on key attributes.
- Provide actionable insights for used car buyers and sellers.

#### 1.2 Deliverables
- Summary report highlighting model performance and key insights including influential factors affecting car prices.
- Trained linear regression model.
- Python script for estimating car prices base on input features.
- Clean, commented code with a guide for replicating the analysis using the model.

#### 1.3 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Microsoft PowerPoint
